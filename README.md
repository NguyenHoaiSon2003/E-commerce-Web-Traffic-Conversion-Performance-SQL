# Analyze Web Traffic & Conversion Performance of Google Merchandise Store â€“ an e-commerce company selling Google-branded products | SQL

Utilizeed SQL in Google BigQuery to write and execute queries to find the desired data

**I. INTRODUCTION**

This project contains an eCommerce dataset that I will explore using SQL on Google BigQuery. The dataset is based on the Google Analytics public dataset and contains data from an eCommerce website.

**II. REQUIREMENTS**
- Google Cloud Platform account
- Project on Google Cloud Platform
- Google BigQuery API enabled
- SQL query editor or IDE

**III. DATASET ACCESS**

The eCommerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset. To access the dataset, follow these steps:
- Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
- Navigate to the BigQuery console and select your newly created project.
- In the navigation panel, select "Add Data" and then "Search a project".
- Enter the project ID "bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions" and click "Enter".
- Click on the "ga_sessions_" table to open it.

**IV. EXPLORING THE DATASET**

In this project, I will write 08 query in Bigquery base on Google Analytics dataset
1. Query 1: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)
